# Problem Statement:
THe aim of this project is to develop a robust sentiment analysis system that can accurately analyze the sentiment of Hindi-English code-mixed text. The system needs to overcome several challenges, including the presence of code-mixed language, language ambiguity, and lack of labeled data for training. The system should be able to handle variations in the use of Hindi and English languages, such as different scripts (Devanagari and Roman), grammatical structures, and transliterated words.


## Motivation
The major driving factors to pursue this project are as follows
- India is a linguistically diverse country with a large population that uses both Hindi and English languages extensively in their day-to-day communication. Code-mixed text is a common way for people to convey their thoughts and feelings, which is indicative of India's dynamic language use. In order to meet the multilingual demands of the Indian population, businesses, governments, and scholars can benefit from knowing the mood of Hindi-English code-mixed text.
- Social media platforms are frequently utilized to convey ideas, feelings, and sentiments through text that has been code-mixed. Monitoring social media, analyzing trends, and tracking user sentiment can all benefit from analyzing the sentiment of code-mixed text. Understanding user feelings in other types of user-generated material, such reviews, comments, and feedback, can also be helpful.
- Sentiment analysis on Hindi-English code-mixed text can help businesses and brands monitor the sentiment of their products, services, or brand reputation among the Hindi-English bilingual audience. It can offer insights into client thoughts, grievances, and feedback, assisting businesses in making wise choices to enhance their products and customer satisfaction.



## Dataset

- The main code-mixed dataset is Sentimix created by [Patwa et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.04277v1.pdf) containing 20k mannually annotated Code-mixed tweets.
- The distribution of the dataset can be seen in the chart shown below
